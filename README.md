# Define Project-Task Relationship:

Each project should have its own list or array to store associated tasks.
Ensure that tasks can be linked or associated with specific projects.

# Display Projects:

Show a list or interface displaying all available projects.
Consider using a sidebar, cards, or a dropdown to list projects.

# Project Selection:

Implement a mechanism to handle the selection of a project by the user.
When a project is selected, display its associated tasks.

# Task Display Mechanism:

Design a way to show tasks specific to the selected project.
Clear the task display area and populate it with tasks related to the chosen project.

# Task Addition:

Create a button or interface to add new tasks to the selected project.
Allow users to input task details like title, description, and date.

# Associating Tasks with Projects:

When a new task is added, ensure it's linked or associated with the currently selected project.

# Task Interaction within Projects:

Implement actions such as editing, deleting, or marking tasks as complete.
Enable users to interact with individual tasks displayed for a specific project.

# UI Clarity:

Visually distinguish tasks for different projects in the user interface.
Use design elements to clearly indicate which tasks belong to which project.

# Event Handling and State Management:

Use event listeners to manage interactions between projects and tasks.
Implement state management to control what tasks are displayed based on the selected project.

# Testing and Refinement:

Continuously test your application to ensure tasks are correctly associated with projects.
Refine user interactions based on testing results and user feedback.

# Local Storage Integration:

After successfully implementing project-task relationships and functionality, consider how to incorporate local storage.
Decide which data (projects, tasks, etc.) needs to be stored in local storage for persistence.
Explore methods like localStorage.setItem() and localStorage.getItem() to save and retrieve data.

# Saving Data to Local Storage:

When a project or task is added, update the local storage with the new data.
Ensure the data is formatted appropriately for storage (typically using JSON.stringify()).

# Retrieving Data from Local Storage:

On page load or app initialization, retrieve data from local storage.
Convert the stored string back to its original format (using JSON.parse()).

# Updating Data in Local Storage:

Implement mechanisms to update local storage whenever changes are made to projects or tasks.

# Handling Edge Cases:

Consider scenarios like clearing local storage, updating stored data structure, or handling data conflicts.

# Testing with Local Storage:

Test your application's functionality while using local storage to ensure data persistence across sessions.

# Refinement and Validation:

Verify that data is being stored correctly and retrieved accurately from local storage.
Refine your implementation based on testing results, addressing any issues that arise.
